Solving metaphilosophy is one way in which we can hope to avoid this kind of disaster. For my previous thoughts on this topic and further motivation see Metaphilosophical Mysteries, The Argument from Philosophical Difficulty, Three AI Safety Related Ideas, and Two Neglected Problems in Human-AI Safety.\nSome interrelated ways of looking at philosophy\nPhilosophy as answering confusing questions\nThis was my starting point for thinking about what philosophy is: it's what we do when we try to answer confusing questions, or questions that we don't have any other established methodology for answering. Why do we find some questions confusing, or lack methods for answering them? This leads to my next thought.\nPhilosophy as ability to generalize / handle distributional shifts\nML systems tend to have a lot of trouble dealing with distributional shifts. (It seems to be a root cause of many AI as well as human safety problems.) But humans seem to have some way of (sometimes) noticing out-of-distribution inputs, and can feel confused instead of just confidently using their existing training to respond to it. This is perhaps most obvious in unfamiliar ethical situations like Torture vs Dust Specks or trying to determine whether our moral circle should include things like insects and RL algorithms. Unlike ML algorithms that extrapolate in an essentially random way when given out-of-distribution inputs, humans can potentially generalize in a principled or correct way, by using philosophical reasoning.\nPhilosophy as slow but general purpose problem solving\nPhilosophy may even be a fully general purpose problem solving technique. At least we don't seem to have reason to think that it's not. The problem is that it's painfully slow and resource intensive. Individual humans acting alone seem to have little chance of achieving justifiably high confidence in many philosophical problems even if they devote their entire lives to those problems. Humanity has been collectively trying to solve some philosophical problems for hundreds or even thousands of years, without arriving at final solutions. The slowness of philosophy explains why distributional shifts remain a safety problem for humans, even though we seemingly have a general way of handling them.\nPhilosophy as meta problem solving\nGiven that philosophy is extremely slow, it makes sense to use it to solve meta problems (i.e., finding faster ways to handle some class of problems) instead of object level problems. This is exactly what happened historically. Instead of using philosophy to solve individual scientific problems (natural philosophy) we use it to solve science as a methodological problem (philosophy of science). Instead of using philosophy to solve individual math problems, we use it to solve logic and philosophy of math. Instead of using philosophy to solve individual decision problems, we use it to solve decision theory. Instead of using philosophy to solve individual philosophical problems, we can try to use it to solve metaphilosophy.\nPhilosophy as \"high computational complexity class\"\nIf philosophy can solve any problem within a very large class, then it must have a \"computational complexity class\" that's as high as any given problem within that class. Computational complexity can be measured in various ways, such as time and space complexity (on various actual machines or models of computation), whether and how high a problem is in the polynomial hierarchy, etc. \"Computational complexity\" of human problems can also be measured in various ways, such as how long it would take to solve a given problem using a specific human, group of humans, or model of human organizations or civilization, and whether and how many rounds of DEBATE would be sufficient to solve that problem either theoretically (given infinite computing power) or in practice.\nThe point here is that no matter how we measure complexity, it seems likely that philosophy would have a \"high computational complexity class\" according to that measure.\nPhilosophy as interminable debate\nThe visible aspects of philosophy (as traditionally done) seem to resemble an endless (both in clock time and in the number of rounds) game of debate, where people propose new ideas, arguments, counterarguments, counter-counterarguments, and so on, and at the same time to try judge proposed solutions based on these ideas and arguments. People sometimes complain about the interminable nature of philosophical discussions, but that now seems understandable if philosophy is a \"high computational complexity\" method of general purpose problem solving.\nIn a sense, philosophy is the opposite of math: whereas in math any debate can be settled by producing a proof (hence analogous to the complexity class NP) (in practice maybe a couple more rounds is needed of people finding or fixing flaws in the proof), potentially no fixed number of rounds of debate (or DEBATE) is enough to settle all philosophical problems.\nPhilosophy as JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber's General TM\nUnlike traditional Turing Machines, a General TM or GTM may edit their previous outputs, and can be considered to solve a problem even if it never terminates, as long as it stops editing its output after a finite number of edits and the final output is the correct solution. So if a GTM solves a certain problem, you know that it will eventually converge to the right solution, but you have no idea when, or if what's on its output tape at any given moment is the right solution. This seems a lot of like philosophy, where people can keep changing their minds (or adjust their credences) based on an endless stream of new ideas, arguments, counterarguments, and so on, and you never really know when you've arrived at a correct answer.\nWhat to do until we solve metaphilosophy?\nProtect the trajectory?\nWhat would you do if you had a GTM that could solve a bunch of really important problems, and that was the only method you had of solving them? You'd try to reverse-engineer it and make a bunch of copies. But if you couldn't do that, then you'd want to put layers and layers of protection around it. Applied to philosophy, this line of thought seems to lead to the familiar ideas of using global coordination (or a decisive strategic advantage) to stop technological progress, or having AIs derive their terminal goals from simulated humans who live in a safe virtual environment.\nReplicate the trajectory with ML?\nAnother idea is to try to build a good enough approximation of the GTM by training ML on its observable behavior (including whatever work tapes you have read access to). But there are two problems with this: 1. This is really hard or impossible to do if the GTM has internal state that you can't observe. And 2. If you haven't already reverse engineered the GTM, there's no good way to know that you've built a good enough approximation, i.e., to know that the ML model won't end up converging to answers that are different from the GTM.\nA three part model of philosophical reasoning\nIt may be easier to understand the difficulty of capturing philosophical reasoning with ML by considering a more concrete model. I suggest we can divide it into three parts as follows:\nA. Propose new ideas/arguments/counterarguments/etc. according to some (implicit) distribution.\nB. Evaluate existing ideas/arguments/counterarguments/etc.\nC. Based on past ideas/arguments/counterarguments/etc., update some hidden state that changes how one does A and B.\nIt's tempting to think that building an approximation of B using ML perhaps isn't too difficult, and then we can just search for the \"best\" ideas/arguments/counterarguments/etc. using standard optimization algorithms (maybe with some safety precautions like trying to avoid adversarial examples for the learned model). There's some chance this could work out well, but without having a deeper understanding of metaphilosophy, I don't see how we can be confident that throwing out A and C won't lead to disaster, especially in the long run. But A and C seem very hard or impossible for ML to capture (A due to paucity of training data, and C due to the unobservable state).\nIs there a way around this difficulty? What else can we do in the absence of a full white-box solution to metaphilosophy?\"\nThis is a snippet extracted from a publication on LessWrong by a site member.\n\nCan you elaborate on the potential dangers of disregarding parts A and C of the philosophical reasoning model, particularly in the context of machine learning?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Certainly. In the context of machine learning, the three-part model of philosophical reasoning proposed here suggests that philosophical reasoning is not just about evaluating ideas (part B), but also about generating new ideas (part A) and updating some hidden state based on past ideas (part C). \n\nPart A, the generation of new ideas or arguments, is crucial for any reasoning system. In philosophy, new ideas often arise from a complex interplay of existing knowledge, intuition, and creativity. If a machine learning model were to disregard this part, it might fail to generate novel insights or solutions to problems. It could become stuck in a loop of evaluating existing ideas without being able to generate new ones. This could limit the model's ability to adapt to new situations or solve complex problems that require out-of-the-box thinking.\n\nPart C, the updating of a hidden state based on past ideas, is also crucial. This part represents the ability to learn from past experiences and to adjust future reasoning based on what has been learned. This is a key component of any learning system. If a machine learning model were to disregard this part, it might fail to learn from its mistakes or to improve its performance over time. It could become stuck in a loop of making the same errors over and over again, without being able to learn from them and adjust its reasoning accordingly.\n\nIn sum, disregarding parts A and C of the philosophical reasoning model could lead to a machine learning model that is unable to generate new ideas or learn from past experiences. This could severely limit the model's problem-solving abilities and its ability to adapt to new situations. It could also lead to a model that is prone to making the same mistakes over and over again, without being able to learn from them and improve.

In the context of human philosophy, this often involves thinking outside the box, challenging existing assumptions, and synthesizing disparate pieces of information in novel ways. It's a key aspect of innovation and progress in philosophical thought.\n\nIn the context of machine learning, creativity could be interpreted as the ability of a model to generate novel solutions or approaches that aren't explicitly present in its training data. This is a challenging aspect to incorporate into machine learning systems, as they are fundamentally data-driven and tend to extrapolate from patterns they've seen in their training data.\n\nHowever, there are ways to encourage creativity in machine learning. One approach is through the use of generative models, which are designed to generate new data that is similar, but not identical, to their training data. This could be used to generate novel ideas or arguments in a philosophical context.\n\nAnother approach is to incorporate elements of randomness or exploration into the learning process. This could involve randomly altering the parameters of the model, or intentionally seeking out areas of the problem space where the model's predictions are uncertain.\n\nFinally, multi-agent systems, where multiple AI models interact with each other, can also lead to emergent creativity, as the models can generate novel strategies or ideas in response to the actions of the other agents.\n\nIt's important to note that while these methods can encourage a form of creativity in machine learning models, it's a different kind of creativity than what we see in humans.

This dynamic environment can produce a variety of outcomes by encouraging exploration, adaptation, and the generation of diverse strategies. Here are some ways in which the dynamics of these systems can contribute to creativity, along with risks and challenges that might arise:\n\n1. Idea generation through diversity: When multiple learning agents are exposed to the same problem or dataset, their individual perspectives, experiences, and development trajectories can lead to different approaches and insights. This diversity of strategies and ideas increases the chances of novel combinations or creative solutions emerging. However, the challenge here lies in managing cooperative vs. competitive dynamics among these agents, as they might get stuck in strategic problems or encourage adversarial behavior.\n\n2. Emergence of emergent behavior: As agents interact and respond to each other's actions, new behaviors can emerge that reflect an aggregate of individual strategies. This can lead to unexpected or novel solutions that aren't present in any single agent's behavior, but arise from the collective interaction. The challenge here is keeping track of and controlling these emergent behaviors, as they can include suboptimal or disruptive strategies.\n\n3. Boosted exploration: Agents in a multi-agent system can encourage each other to explore uncharted areas by rewarding or imitating exploratory behavior. This can increase the chances of discovering novel strategies or solutions. However, sacrificing exploitation for exploration might come with consequences as it can slow down the overall learning process or result in over-investment in unpromising avenues.\n\n4. Cross-fertilization of ideas: Like in-person brainstorming or collaborations, agents in a multi-agent system can share their insights and strategies, leading to the refinement or combination of these ideas. This can also result in novel solutions that build on existing strategies or incorporate new perspectives. One challenge can be coordinating and regulating the flow of information among agents and ensuring that less efficient or incorrect solutions aren't widely shared or adopted.\n\n5. Learning from others' mistakes: When multiple agents interact, they can learn from each other's mistakes as well as successes. This helps in avoiding dead-end paths and accelerating the learning process. However, it also requires mechanisms to determine which agent's strategies or decisions should be prioritized, and how to prevent the propagation of consistently incorrect approaches.\n\nIn summary, multi-agent systems provide an environment in which creativity in machine learning models can emerge through dynamic interactions and learning. While this creativity has the potential to yield novel and valuable solutions, managing the complexity of such systems and addressing potential risks and challenges is an ongoing area of study and development in AI research and engineering.", "role": "assistant"}], "chosen": [{"content": "\"A powerful AI (or human-AI civilization) guided by wrong philosophical ideas would likely cause astronomical (or beyond astronomical) waste.

The dynamics of these systems play a crucial role in shaping this process.\n\n1. Diversity: The first factor that influences the emergence of novel strategies or ideas is the diversity of the individual agents. If the agents have diverse starting points, learning algorithms, or objectives, they are likely to explore different areas of the problem space. This can lead to different perspectives being considered and potentially novel solutions being generated.\n\n2. Communication: Effective communication among agents can also foster creativity. If agents can share information or strategies, they can build upon each other's work and potentially generate novel ideas. However, this can also lead to the spread of misinformation or inefficient strategies, so managing the flow of information within the system is crucial.\n\n3.

However, too much competition can lead to uncooperative behavior, where agents are more focused on undermining others than generating novel solutions.\n\n4. Cooperation: On the other hand, cooperation can encourage agents to build upon each other's work and share insights. However, too much cooperation can lead to a lack of innovation, as agents may just reinforce each other's existing strategies instead of exploring new ideas.\n\nManaging these systems can present several risks and challenges:\n\n1. Coordination: Coordinating the actions and interactions of multiple agents can be challenging. This becomes more difficult as the number of agents grows, as the complexity of the system scales up exponentially.\n\n2. Alignment: Ensuring that the goals and objectives of the individual agents are aligned with the overall objective of the system can be difficult, especially when agents are making decisions based on partial information or imperfect models of the world.\n\n3. Trust: In multi-agent systems involving different organizations/parties, trust can become an issue. Agents may not share information or engage in cooperative behavior if they can't trust the other agents in the system.\n\n4. Safety: Ensuring that the system operates safely is a major concern. If the agents are generating novel solutions or strategies, it's possible that some of these might be harmful or undesirable. Ensuring that the system is designed in such a way that it does not compromise safety is a major challenge.\n\n5. Scalability: As the number of agents and their interactions grow, the computational demands on the system also increase. Managing the scalability of these systems can be a significant challenge.\n\nIn conclusion, multi-agent systems can foster creativity in machine learning models through emergence. The dynamics of these systems, such as the diversity of agents, communication, competition, and cooperation, play a crucial role in shaping the emergence of novel strategies or ideas.

Over several years, Group B could gradually take control of more territory and resources through attrition and switching popular support away from Group A. \n\n- There is potential for Group A to fracture along political lines as failures mount. This could precipitate the collapse of Group A control and victory for Group B's insurgency campaign.\n\nIn summary, given the described circumstances, I would expect Group B to eventually prevail through a long war of attrition and shifting popular support, even if starting with weaker conventional military capabilities. Their greater skills and local advantages could offset Group A's larger force size.", "role": "assistant"}], "metadata": null}

These objects move in elliptical orbits around the star, and their relative positions and movements can give astronomers insight into the dynamics of the system.\n\nThe appearance of a solar system can vary depending on factors such as the size and brightness of the central star, the distances and angles between the objects in the system, and the presence of dust or other matter that can affect the way that light passes through the system. In some cases, a solar system may appear as a clear and distinct set of objects orbiting a central point, while in other cases it may appear more diffuse or amorphous.\n\nIt's also important to note that when we talk about the \"shape\" of a solar system, we're generally referring to the overall distribution and arrangement of objects within the system, rather than the physical shape of the system itself.
